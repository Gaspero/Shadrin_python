Our goal is to allow anyone who’s in need of cash to easily borrow from the Celsius platform without having to sell their crypto holdings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, through the Celsius Network, cryptocurrencies deposited by members into their Celsius Wallet will be available on the network for immediate borrowing and shorting.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/celsius.jpg","website_url":"https://celsius.network/crowdsale/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://celsius.network/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/celsius_whitepaper-march14-2.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Khj9lRvl64","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"USA","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":7,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-03-16","end_date":"2018-03-23","pre_ico_start_date":"2017-10-25","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-03-16","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0.20 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"325,000,000","available_for_sale":"325,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, USD","restricted_areas":"North Korea, Syria, USA","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/savedroid/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"SVD","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"savedroid","tags":"Investment, Artificial Intelligence, Banking, Cryptocurrency","industry":0,"short_description":"Democratizing cryptocurrencies","long_description":"Users profit from easy access to smart Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, Dash etc. savings plans, and superior crypto investment opportunities, such as portfolios, futures, and ICOs, without any technological adoption barriers. savedroid leverages its existing core assets of self-learning AI technology and great User Experience, based on maximum simplification and emotional gamification, to deliver this exceptional value proposition.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/savedroid.jpg","website_url":"https://ico.savedroid.com/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://ico.savedroid.com/savedroid-ico-whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRDK5aqiP1U","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Germany","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":20,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-09","end_date":"2018-03-09","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-01-12","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-01-26","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 EUR = 100 SVD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"6,000,000,000","available_for_sale":"6,000,000,000","accepting":"EUR, USD, BTC, ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/streamity/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"STM","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Streamity","tags":"Cryptocurrency, Platform, Smart Contract","industry":0,"short_description":"Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange","long_description":"The key element of STREAMITY is StreamDesk decentralized application for exchange of cryptocurrency to fiat money without intermediaries on the basis of smart contracts.

Escaping the cubicle is within reach for millions of workers, Blok will assist in helping them achieve this freedom.\r\n\r\nBlok leverages blockchain technology to connect employers and on-demand workers across the globe. The Blok directory uses smart contracts to eliminate friction in terms of time, cost, quality, and transparency in matching workers and companies.\r\n \r\nA company creates a gig that is verified in the Blok directory. A Blokpreneur (an on-demand worker) can then search the directory and apply directory to the gig. This relationship provides a better and faster solution in fulfilling consumer needs in the on-demand economy. Blok allows consumers, companies, and workers all to benefit from blockchain technology.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/blok.jpg","website_url":"http://blok.network?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"http://blok.network/assets/blok-whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSCn4S1WKhE","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Estonia","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":5,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-04-10","end_date":"2018-05-10","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC223","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"41000 ETH","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"5700 BLK = 1 ETH","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"230,400,000","available_for_sale":"230,400,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"USA, China","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/crowd-machine/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"CMCT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Crowd Machine (PreICO)","tags":"Platform, Cryptocurrency, Communication, Business services, Software","industry":0,"short_description":"Powering Blockchain","long_description":"Crowd Machine is creating the Crowd Computer, a decentralized app execution engine that is powered by a peer-to-peer network of Crowd Virtual Machines (\"CVM\") that run on peer devices by device owners who are paid for their excess capacity.

Reductions in the manufacturing of physical currency will be noticeable, as well as reducing the amount of change lost by consumers.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/digitize.jpg","website_url":"http://www.digitizecoin.com/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"http://www.digitizecoin.com/whitepaper","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F4kLVM-d7q4","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Australia","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":11,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-05-04","end_date":"2018-05-11","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-04-06","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-04-13","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"600 ETH","hard_cap":"10% of total supply","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 DTZ= 0.0002 ETH","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"200,000,000","available_for_sale":"200,000,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/etheera/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"ETA","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Etheera","tags":"Platform, Real estate, Software","industry":0,"short_description":"Real estate for the blockchain","long_description":"The Etheera project was established initially in 2017 by IZ Immobilien Kriens GmbH.\r\nThe IZ Real Estate Kriens GmbH is a Swiss-based company that is active in the real estate field since 2013.

There were many application developers for wearable glasses, but there were no device management platforms for IT to centrally control all of the new devices coming onto their systems. Our CEO, Pete Wassell led the creation of an industrial-strength platform that would make controlling these devices simple and more complete for securing and provisioning them. \r\n\r\nThe basic premise of Augmate is to allow control of multiple, disparate devices easily and efficiently without sacrificing security in the data. It acts as a software layer that in the past, resided on the devices just over the operating system. Signed by the keys of the device, the code allowed for virtually full control of that device from a web based portal. \r\n\r\nAugmate is upgrading its infrastructure to leverage distributed ledger technology in order to refine data security and put users back in control of their own data. At its core, Augmate Connect will be a blockchain-agnostic platform, and may eventually integrate other private and public blockchain protocols bringing interoperability to device management.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/augmate.jpg","website_url":"https://www.augmate.io?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://www.saftlaunch.com/download/project/8lSop2drNtUhzqFN3WeWolgdu9A4r83M0yQL78dE.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDUDPLlrhYQ","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"USA","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":9,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-01-01","end_date":"2018-06-30","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 MATE = 0.015 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"15,000,000,000","available_for_sale":"15,000,000,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"China","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/baappay/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"BAAP","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Baappay","tags":"Banking","industry":0,"short_description":"The Evolution of the Payment Platform is Here","long_description":"BaapPay is a multi-layered platform that integrates both fiat and cryptocurrency payment services for merchants, that will confirm and guarantee all payments in seconds.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/baappay.jpg","website_url":"https://baappaytoken.com?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://baappaytoken.com/skin/frontend/rwd/default/pdf/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEg22MkrwI8","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Canada","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":10,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"0001-01-01","end_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-03-01","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-03-20","token_type":"ERC 20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1ETH = 4200 BAAP","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"94,000,000","available_for_sale":"94,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, LTC, BTH, USD, XRP","restricted_areas":"USA, Canada, The Republic of China or Singapore","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/bazista/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"BZS","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Bazista","tags":"Cryptocurrency, Platform, Retail","industry":0,"short_description":"For lady and mister!","long_description":"Bazista is the first B2C and C2C trading platform empowering nowdays E-Commerce industry with digital assets.

By participating within the platform, there will be a fundamental change in relationship with the consumer, empowering them to shop for insurance and utilities by being in control of their data and rewarded for doing so. This new ‘privacy bank’ will also close the gap on the collection of personally identifiable information (PII), which has been a serious issue with information phished on the internet, leading at times to identity theft.

This is the core of our business, and mobile network operators will be at the center of our strategy. Telcoin is the first cryptocurrency to tap into synergies between the reach of mobile telecoms and the fast, borderless nature of blockchain technology. According to the World Bank, there are nearly five times as many mobile phones in the world (5 billion), as there are active bank accounts (1.2 billion). It's a lot easier to access mobile phone services than banking services, and we aim to capitalize on that disparity. We will initially offer Telcoin to our mobile network partners, providing their customers with seamless access to the digital economy: online remittances, transfers, payments, and ecommerce. We will also provide the necessary marketing and product development resources to nurture the Telcoin ecosystem, in a joint effort with our telecom partners. Our objective is not to compete with telecom mobile money, but to cooperatively participate in the overall mobile money ecosystem. We see ourselves as a complementary solution; a tool that will increasingly bring users to mobile money, cryptocurrency-backed solutions, and mobile wallets. Our goal is to become one of the cornerstone financial inclusion efforts of the 21st century and we want to cooperate with actors who we believe can play a critical role in this process, namely mobile network operators.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/telcoin.jpg","website_url":"http://www.telco.in/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"http://www.telco.in/docs/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1jXhrICUuI","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Japan","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":10,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"0001-01-01","end_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_start_date":"2017-12-11","pre_ico_end_date":"2017-12-23","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"10,000,000 USD","hard_cap":"25,000,000 USD","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"20% of the total supply of coins","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"20,000,000,000","available_for_sale":"20,000,000,000","accepting":"BTC, ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/tutellus/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"TUT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Tutellus","tags":"Education","industry":0,"short_description":"The EdTech platform that pays you for learning","long_description":"The platform that pays you for learning.

Until now, people have given their data away to companies in exchange for centralized access to application and services. Examples include uploading and tagging photos, tracking and sharing your location and access to purchase history, to name a few. To provide a fair and balanced intelligence available to all equally, we must create AI economies that any agent can participate in and receive some reward for doing so. Enter Synapse AI. Synapse AI solves this problem by tokenizing an agent's work on the Synapse AI market using SYN utility tokens, thus facilitating an economy between participants and transferring value to those participants. This accelerates a system that grows beyond the means of capacity of any one single company or organization. By opening this data and using machine learning models through decentralized marketplace formats on the blockchain, and by tokenizing contributors, we can create syndicates that provide the greatest benefit to users everywhere.

Thousands of books already exist within the iShook ecosystem, and an immense number of users are already leveraging our existing platform. The social reading experience has already been initiated and is well underway on iShook. Content creators and consumers have both, publishing options and markup abilities at hand only to enhance their experience. The iShook ecosystem doesn’t just include our web application, but a developed mobile app, a news aggregator, and an eCommerce Store\r\n                                       iShook currently facilitates over 12,000 publishers and over 60,000 ebooks through our partner “Gardners UK” www.gardners.com.

It is expected that WinFlow will quickly disrupt the traditional incumbents in the multi billion-dollar market.\r\n\r\nTraditional operating models result in the house raking significant profit from its players, but WinFlow intends to turn the tables. Instead of retaining the house rake, the platform will automatically redistribute the would-be profits to players through a transparent and secure Ethereum smart contract-based system.

The majority of people owning cryptocurrency in the current market keep them in exchanges and often have no idea what a masternode is. If understood correctly, masternode investment can be very helpful and useful for those who are not very familiar or knowledgeable about plain trading. Masternode does not require much skills in investing so long as it is set up and is maintainable, because its rewards are automatically given. \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem with the current cryptocurrency market is that 1) People do not know what masternode is, 2) even if they do know about masternode, individual investors usually do not have enough money to form a masternode by oneself, 3) those investors still have to overcome technical barriers if they were to initiate a masternode of their own. APIS aims to provide answers to these questions by informing people about the concept of a masternode, helping them invest with relatively low principle investment, and aiding individuals to form a masternode by helping them with technical difficulties. By doing so, APIS will be able to bring about more people’s participation to the world of cryptocurrency as well as the world of masternode. \r\n\r\nIn order to do so, APIS provides two solutions: first, the APIS native QRC-20 token that carries value within the APIS ecosystem to allow people's entry into pools of different masternode-capable coins; second, the online website and mobile application that facilitates easy setup of masternode through the use of APIS tokens. With the entire system in place, investors will be able to get APIS token as much as they want to invest in a specific masternode pool and gain principle plus the appropriate share of the block reward after the reward cycle with the relative ease of a few clicks.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/apis.jpg","website_url":"https://apisplatform.io?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://apisplatform.io/whitepaper.en.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNdetp5LpWA","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Singapore","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":20,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-03-04","end_date":"2018-04-03","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-02-20","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-02-20","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1QTUM = 5,000APIS","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"5,236,000,000","available_for_sale":"5,236,000,000","accepting":"ETH, QTUM","restricted_areas":"USA, China","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/beep/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"BEEP","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Beep","tags":"Business services, Platform","industry":0,"short_description":"Skill-sharing platform","long_description":"Beep is a skill‒sharing platform that connects “job seeker” and “job offerer” together, and allows you to execute everything, from offering a job to payment, from your smartphone.

It is first in the market to be backed by Ethereum. As a result, it will serve as the first ‘Casper’ mining pool to the digital token Market. ‘Casper’ is known as the ‘Proof of Stake’ or POS upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain. This particular upgrade goes green regarding energy usage, in which the Ethereum blockchain no longer uses energy-wasting ‘Proof of Work’ mining, but rather, more secure, energy saving POS. In order for POS to be profitable for those with limited Ether, they will need to pool Ether with others. Mithril Ore is the first advanced staking pool to the market and will utilize this service in a crowd-friendly way.\r\n\r\nOne hundred percent of the Ethereum raised in the Mithril Ore token crowdsale will be placed into the Ether Pool – with none taken as profits. As an additional feature of the Mithril Ore token, all staking gains from ‘Casper’ will also be returned to the Mithril Ore Ether Pool for increased stake value; thereby, adding to the Mithril Ore token base value.\r\n\r\nMithril Ore tokens are limited in number and therefore scarce. In future years, we will offer the “blacksmith option,” which will be offered to consolidate Mithril Ore tokens, generating new specialized item tokens. With consolidation, ‘blacksmith minted’ item tokens offer annual, limited time, limited edition tokens that connote concentrated values and privileges to tokenholders.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/mithril-ore.jpg","website_url":"https://www.mithrilore.io?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://www.mithrilore.io/docs/mithrilore%20-%20whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_beJB0dQEKQ","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"0","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":9,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-04","end_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"465,000","available_for_sale":"465,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/netzero/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"NETZ","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"NETZERO","tags":"Cryptocurrency, Infrastructure","industry":0,"short_description":"Capital Rise","long_description":"NetZero is primed to become a leading clean-tech asset developer maximising profitability by using its closed loop cluster model built on open ledger smart contracts.\r\n\r\nNetZero has several high value projects in the pipeline and is ready to scale these up to achieve maximum asset potential within its eco-green portfolio.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/netzero.jpg","website_url":"https://netzero.uci.global/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://netzero.uci.global/misc/Whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlBqKQW-UZY?ecver=2","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Sweden","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":6,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-01-15","end_date":"2018-06-15","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 NETZ = 0.58 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"340,000,000","available_for_sale":"340,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, LTC, BCH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/plenus/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"PLNS","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Plenus","tags":"Banking, Investment","industry":0,"short_description":"The very first Diversification Token","long_description":"The Plenus Token is an ERC20 Token with the main purpose to diversify risk associated with holding one single cryptocurrency.

This is a key differentiator for Yield Coin compared to other tokens and cryptocurrencies. The team behind Yield Coin have over 100 years' of combined experience in the Finance and Technology sectors, and are highly motivated and committed to the success of Yield Coin. The elimination of the single point of failure flaw in conjunction with the highly skilled and diversified team provide the foundation for Yield Coin’s success.

Then open source developers will be able to monetize their algorithms, while the whole world will be able to use them at scale.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/singularitynet.jpg","website_url":"https://singularitynet.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://public.singularitynet.io/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFFHsmtQs6w","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Switzerland","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":9,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2017-12-19","end_date":"2017-12-19","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"500,000,000","available_for_sale":"500,000,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/smartlands/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"SLT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Smartlands","tags":"Investment, Platform","industry":0,"short_description":"Worldwide Platform for ICOs","long_description":"The platform will eliminate the barriers for investors from all over the world and provide unique\r\nopportunity to finance the introduction of agtech innovations by applying blockchain technology to solve problems typical for classical financial markets.

We are now adding the ability for any community to create a localized currency and use it as a reward for local consumption. The CLN is a payment system that is powered by everyday consumption. The network allows communities to issue their own currency and use it to incentivise merchants and consumers for buying and selling locally with fiat. The CLN aims to utilize the power of cryptocurrencies to create a better, more transparent payment system and strengthen the sense of mutual responsibility in the community. This encourages local spending and keeps more money circulating in the community, thus multiplying the local economic activity. The CLN token is the first currency attached to real life consumption. The token will be issued on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token and will provide access to the CLN network and will enable communities to bootstrap.

These include, but are not limited to, an exchange that is in development, a debit MasterCard, and the Vaultbank Fund, which will be comprised of an asset backed credit portfolio. Vaultbank intends to build token value with its experienced management team and, subject to the board and holders of voting shares, pay quarterly dividends to its token holders. The Vaultbank investment opportunity is available to accredited investors per Reg D, Section 506(c) and Reg S, as an exempt offering. Vaultbank will create an asset backed credit portfolio by utilizing the expertise of the Vaultbank senior portfolio management team from established financial firms with the artificial intelligence and machine learning talent of Random Forest Capital, a San Francisco quantitative hedge fund. Vaultbank intends to then use a warehouse line of credit to provide leveraged returns for token investors. Further making cryptocurrency accessible to consumers, Vaultbank will be offering a debit card to facilitate purchasing everyday items using cryptocurrencies at point-of-sale terminals around the world. The Vaultbank debit card will allow cryptocurrency investors and consumers to facilitate foreign exchange transactions at highly competitive rates on seventeen (17) of the largest global currencies and to use their holdings as tender. Additionally, Vaultbank is in development on the Vaultbank cryptocurrency exchange, a secure cryptocurrency ICO investing and trading portal that plans to offer low transaction fees, reliable customer service, and access to other private security tokens offerings as well as trading of utility tokens.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/vaultbank.jpg","website_url":"https://vaultbank.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://vaultbank.io/files/VaultBankWhitePaper_v3.8.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/36_PewwOBbg","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"USA","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":1,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-01-18","end_date":"2018-02-18","pre_ico_start_date":"2017-12-13","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-01-17","token_type":"0","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1.00 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"200,000,000","available_for_sale":"200,000,000","accepting":"0","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/vr-platform-oko/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"OKOIN","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"VR Platform OKO","tags":"Platform, Media, Entertainment, Virtual Reality","industry":0,"short_description":"An Evolution In The Porn Industry","long_description":"The first decentralized blockchain-based VR platform for 100 % anonymous adult content distribution.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/vr-platform-oko.jpg","website_url":"https://okoin.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://okoin.io/wp.pdf?v=1","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzqT-42hzdY","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Czech Republic","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":4,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2017-12-14","end_date":"2018-04-25","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"80000000 USD","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 OKOIN = 1 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"0","available_for_sale":"0","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/webcoin/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"WEB","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Webcoin (PreICO)","tags":"Business services, Communication, Cryptocurrency, Platform","industry":0,"short_description":"Digital Marketing 2.0","long_description":"Webcoin connects the worlds of digital marketing, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.

We aim to establish a niche that runs exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Raffles are already popular but suffer from a lack of transparency. With the innovation of the Ethernet protocol, RAFL can provide a service to protect users from fraud. This creates a completely transparent and provably fair raffle which is safe for all. How it works. Choose your selling price and the number of tickets. When all tickets are purchased, one is chosen at random. The seller can list products at a higher price than current e-commerce platforms and auction sites, and at the same time users can try their luck to acquire goods for a fraction of their retail price. Users can also buy multiple tickets to increase their chances of winning. E.g.: A luxury watch worth $5000 sells 250 tickets at $20 each The raffle winner gets a watch with a value of $5000 for $20.

Kencoin solves this problem in one stroke, with a completely anonymous cryptocurrency that leverages blockchain technology to provide users with anonymity, privacy and secured transactions, while delivering previously unreachable alpha to adult industry merchants.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/kencoin.jpg","website_url":"https://kencoin.org/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"http://kencoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfVEaSVXtl4","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Switzerland","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":3,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2017-08-22","end_date":"2017-09-22","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"0","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0.07 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"600,000,000","available_for_sale":"600,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/moneytech/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"MT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"MoneyTech","tags":"Cryptocurrency","industry":0,"short_description":"Mining technologies for everyone","long_description":"Our mining capacities are located in Ukraine, where one of the world's lowest cost of consumed electricity, needed to ensure the production of crypto currency.

Developers can develop and add new assets through an open plugins system keeping the wallet lightweight. The second component is a validator hosted on the Safenetwork. Users will connect to the Safenetwork through the wallet to exchange. An application will match the orders issued by the users and check all transactions and order informations are valid. Unlike centralized and semi-centralized exchanges, there isn’t a wallet acting as a relay. Transactions are processed simultaneously through an order matching engine from one wallet to another. The validator on the Safenetwork will check if the transactions are valid prior to being exchanged. The orders are then matched and transactions broadcasted in their respective networks.

Harnessing over two decades of experience serving the securitization sector, we apply cascading levels of credit enhancements to offer unprecedented risk reduction towards unsecured loans. Interest cost reduction is one of the most important motivations in securitization. It is often done via credit enhancement. We can apply the same principles to reduce the high interest rates normally associated with unsecured loans, making it attractive to both borrowers and lenders. Our goal at FintruX Network is to disrupt the way unsecured loans are being originated and administered. This innovative concept solves three major issues for small businesses, especially startups, to borrow from accredited investors and financial institutions. By applying credit enhancements, FintruX Network seeks to neutralize the lender's credit risk and, in the case of a default, provide cascading levels of insurances to cover the loss – thereby increasing the overall credit rating and lowering interest rates simultaneously. The four cascading levels of credit enhancement include over-collateralization as additional collateral, a local third-party guarantor, cross-collateralization as insurance, and FintruX ultimate protection reserve. A unique smart contract is generated and deployed by FintruX Network for each individual borrowing at real time to provide unambiguous, immutable, and censorship resistant records where no arbitration is required. In addition to simplifying the loan application process via instant matching, FintruX Network also provides borrowers with post-funding self-serve administration options such as refinance and prepayment. FintruX Network is a multi-sided marketplace and ecosystem that delivers value not just to borrowers and lenders, but also to third-party guarantors and specialized service agents. We are making borrowing and lending a no-brainer for both borrowers and investors.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/fintrux.jpg","website_url":"https://www.fintrux.com/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://www.fintrux.com/home/doc/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Singapore","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":6,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-07","end_date":"2018-02-28","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-01-07","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-01-21","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 ETH = 1,500 FTX","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"0","available_for_sale":"0","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/gif-by-socifi/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"GIF","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"GIF by SOCIFI","tags":"Platform, Internet","industry":0,"short_description":"Blockchain-based Marketplace for sponsored data","long_description":"Our ultimate dream is for every smartphone owner to be able to install the SOCIFI Engagement Solution (SES) and cover their mobile data expenses by interacting with the sponsored content.

Using transparent ledgers which can be seen by anyone and which cannot be tampered with, we provide parents with a system that guarantees peace of mind. Not only are parents able to earn up to 40% rewards from purchases of Baby and Maternity products within the FamilyPoints ecosystem, but they can spend it on a variety of services through the platform, especially on child education services. With a fully transparent ecosystem, parents can also trust that the reviews they see for products and service providers are completely honest. FamilyPoints is the first platform of its kind to be based on blockchain, a new technology which offers the FamilyPoints community a secure and transparent platform for transactions, referral programs, rewards, reviews, and education services. By cutting out the middleman, we can provide rewards which have real-world economic value to parents. We work directly with selected producers and brands, eliminate all unnecessary markups, and pass the savings on to parents. For parents who make a purchase, the rewards they receive can vary from between 5% to 40% of the cost of purchase. Parents can spend their rewards on the FamilyPoints platform to buy different kinds of services, from access to educational videos, to classes, and even insurance or family holidays which are focused on children and parents. Parents may even have the option to convert their rewards to cash in the future. The platform currently offers educational services that include online courses, live consultations with experts (beta version), access to the biggest parenting library in the world with 1,150 educational videos, webinars, and booking for offline classes centers. For customers, this means that FamilyPoints can also provide educational services and satisfy the needs of parents and children. We encourage customers to post content and provide feedback about the products and services we offer on FamilyPoints. Other users can then upvote helpful content and reviews with points (similar to Steem.it’s service). Not only does this create a sense of community, but it also lets honest reviews do the marketing rather than paid promotions.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/familypoints.jpg","website_url":"https://familypoints.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://familypointsio.r.worldssl.net/pdf/whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"0","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":13,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-28","end_date":"2018-03-27","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-02-21","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-02-27","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0.10 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"250,000,000","available_for_sale":"250,000,000","accepting":"XEM, BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, Fiat","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/joint-ventures/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"Joint","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"Joint Ventures","tags":"Internet, Media, Smart Contract","industry":0,"short_description":"Blockchain Economy for Online Publishers","long_description":"Joint Ventures brings a much-needed change to the current digital content landscape.

Crestonium Platform uses a standard OpenAPI so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, and any other contract or exchange also using this standard.\r\n\r\nCrestonium is offering not just a Mobile app but also a fully synchronized Desktop app. Crestonium connects your blockchain assets for everyday use. The credit card and banking license will allow us to be a hub for the blockchain ecosystem, to connect you to the real-world. We are using a protocol where every blockchain is connected which enables us to provide you with 0% fees. The blockchain ecosystem also allows us to scale for the masses and be more inclusive.\r\n\r\nOne important feature that we’ve implemented into our ICO offering is a Protection guarantee to our Token Holders. If within 6 months (that is after the sale of ICO has ended) the value of CXS doesn’t increase by 150%, we will give our users back their purchase originally deposited and exchanged for CXS.\r\n\r\nWe believe in our product and aim to develop the best, which is why we offer this proposition. Hence the token holder has nothing to lose – either their investment will increase by 150% and they can sell or retain the CXS, or they can claim their original investment back. We do not guarantee investment return, but we do guarantee refund policy.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/crestonium.jpg","website_url":"https://crestonium.io?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://crestonium.io/Whitepaper/Crestonium_Whitepaper_1.01.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Switzerland","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":12,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-21","end_date":"2018-04-07","pre_ico_start_date":"2018-02-14","pre_ico_end_date":"2018-02-20","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 CXS = 0.00002 BTC","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"365,000,000","available_for_sale":"365,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, LTC, Various","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/emu-project/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"EMU","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"EMU Project","tags":"Software, Entertainment","industry":0,"short_description":"A simple solution for the entire service industry","long_description":"A simple solution for the entire service industry.

This ability to capture authentic user engagement at the point of interaction forms the basis of the emerging “Attention Economy”, in what has come to be called “proof of brain” technology. The foundation of ViceToken.com is built on a “fork” of the code that powers the opensource Steem blockchain, which generates and distributes Steem tokens as users consume internet content, simultaneously recording proof of such interactions on an immutable ledger. We modified (“forked”) the open-source code that powers the Steem network to meet the specific needs of the adult content industry.\r\n\r\nViceToken.com awards tokens, called “VIT”, to each stakeholder in the adult content distribution transaction chain. We trademarked the phrase “Get Paid To Watch Porn” to emphasize the benefit of the VIT platform for adult content viewers. The process of recording and authenticating viewer interaction on a ledger through generation of VIT tokens also permits content producers to more accurately identify viewer preferences, allowing them to refine and create better content for viewers.\r\n\r\nTo kickstart the VIT network, ViceToken.com has partnered with prominent adult content brands to make their content available on the VIT network, and will also offer a B2B implementation assistance program to other content producers to integrate VIT into their web monetization strategy.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/vice-industry-token.jpg","website_url":"https://vicetoken.com/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://vicetoken.com/static/Vice_Industry_Token_Whitepaper.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Canada","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":6,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-02-20","end_date":"2018-03-20","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 VIT = 0.05 USD","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"2,000,000,000","available_for_sale":"2,000,000,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"No","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/blockfood/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"BFT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"BlockFood","tags":"Platform, Cryptocurrency, Software","industry":0,"short_description":"Give the sharing economy back to the people.","long_description":"BlockFood is a non-profit decentralized food ordering platform, based on Smart Contracts.

PressCoin publications will not allow readers to engage in comments or interact with anonymous accounts. Like De Correspondent, PressCoin will allow limited access to read its content, but to read full stories, interact with journalists, or comment on stories, users will have to pay for a subscription or make micropayments for individual stories.

We stand for any business that wants to raise capital to grow. We stand for any investor who wants to buy shares in businesses they believe in. That’s why we built Chainium. To connect businesses directly to investors, using blockchain. To make buying and selling shares easy. Our platform is already available as a prototype on our website. It provides solutions to the problem of raising capital for large enterprises and smaller businesses alike. We offer business owners access to the sophisticated tools and techniques of the listed markets for a fraction of the price. For investors we provide direct access to a huge range of equity offers previously only open to institutional investors, for zero fees. Raising capital through equity in the traditional way is a complicated and costly process. Running an IPO takes months of planning, multiple engagements with advisors, negotiations with banks and law firms to gain regulatory approval, and pitches to attract institutional investors. The process takes a minimum of twelve months, attracts hefty fees, and the end result is uncertain. Our back-to-basics approach to raising capital reduces bureaucracy, whilst our use of blockchain technology removes duplication and eliminates errors. We allow investors and businesses to exchange digital share certificates for fiat or crypto-currency in a transparent, tamper proof and immutable distributed ledger. No intermediary or other reconciliation steps are involved in transactions, cutting through hundreds of legacy systems and solutions from the old world.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/chainium.jpg","website_url":"https://www.chainium.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://www.chainium.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chainium_Whitepaper_v2_0.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Liechtenstein","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":6,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2017-12-25","end_date":"2018-01-12","pre_ico_start_date":"2017-11-27","pre_ico_end_date":"2017-12-18","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"0","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"50,000,000","available_for_sale":"50,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, LTC, EUR","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/coinfi/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"COF","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"CoinFi","tags":"Platform","industry":0,"short_description":"The democratization of Wall Street","long_description":"CoinFi offers crowdsourced and professionally curated research, analysis, trading signals, trading algorithms, and market-moving news to give cryptocurrency traders the real-time market intelligence needed to gain an edge.

The same year a company under the name S.P.E. “ELIS” was registered in Latvia (where there is a base of highly qualified specialists in the field of electronics and medicine). In the presented project we unite 2 directions: innovative, unique equipment of our own production + Blockchain Medical Platform, which is developed in cooperation with doctors, specialists and patients. Another very promising area for further development, we consider to be the creation of a network of small and medium sized health centers, where people can get diagnostics, pass tests and receive a proper treatment, combining all this with recreation. First centers is planned to establish in the Mediterranean region. We decided to opt for fundraising through the blockchain system and entering the ICO in order to accelerate the completion of the commenced unique developments that have no analogues in the world and the subsequent entry into the world market. In our project, we ensure that ICO participants are protected and receive benefits from participation. We consider our project to be not only an attractive and highly profitable financial side, but also a high social importance and responsibility as it is meant to increase the availability of medical and healthcare services, to improve the diagnostics capabilities of various diseases and significantly increase the rate of healing and timely assistance.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/elcoin.jpg","website_url":"https://elcoin.io/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://elcoin.io/White_Paper%200.9_v3.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"Latvia","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":3,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2018-01-08","end_date":"2018-06-25","pre_ico_start_date":"2017-11-19","pre_ico_end_date":"2017-12-17","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"30000000 USD","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 ELC = 0.0033 ETH","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"30,000,000","available_for_sale":"30,000,000","accepting":"ETH, BTC, LTC, Fiat","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/fast-invest/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"FIT","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"FAST INVEST","tags":"Platform, Investment, Banking","industry":0,"short_description":"Merge fiat and cryptocurrencies","long_description":"FAST INVEST is building digital investment bank.

The platform allows players to own their digital cards, win real prizes in tournaments, and earn copies of cards through proof of stake. As with traditional trading card games, players construct decks consisting of a combination of cards and battle each other in gaming arenas for glory and prizes. Both the digital cards and Nova Tokens are ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, so players can buy, sell, and trade directly on the blockchain. As players own the digital cards in their collection, they will be able to sell these cards for Nova Tokens on the in-game card exchange and on the Ethereum blockchain. The Nova Token is designed specifically to address the needs of game developers and card gamers. The Nova Token addresses the 3 critical pain points in the digital trading card games market, i.e. giving players real ownership – not license of use – of their digital items, providing a marketplace for trading digital items, and enhancing collectability and value of digital items. The Nova Blitz platform also allows third party game developers to deploy their games on the platform, thereby spurring the growth of the game development industry.","avatar_url":"https://icobench.com/images/icos/icons/nova-blitz.jpg","website_url":"https://novablitz.com/?utm_source=icobench","whitepaper_url":"https://docs.novablitz.com/Nova+Token+White+Paper.pdf","promo_video":"","founders_residency":"","incorporation_country":"USA","other_info":"","connected_peoples":null,"connected_projects":null,"team_size":8,"ventuary_score":0.0,"ventuary_investment_score":0.0,"ventuary_team_score":0.0,"bench_general_score":0.0,"icoRaitings_general_score":0.0,"start_date":"2017-12-11","end_date":"2018-01-10","pre_ico_start_date":"0001-01-01","pre_ico_end_date":"0001-01-01","token_type":"ERC20","soft_cap":"0","hard_cap":"0","average_industry_hard_cap":"0","ico_token_price":"1 ETH = 1000000 NVT","presale_tokens":"0","total_tokens":"75,000,000","available_for_sale":"75,000,000","accepting":"ETH","restricted_areas":"0","platform":0},{"links":{"self":"http://ventuary.com/api/companies/onegram/","connectedproject":null,"connectedpeople":null},"status":0,"status_display":"UNDEFINED","industry_display":"UNDEFINE","ticker":"OGC","mod_date":"2018-05-07","title":"OneGram","tags":"Cryptocurrency","industry":0,"short_description":"Backed by one gram of gold","long_description":"OneGram uses blockchain technology to create a new kind of cryptocurrency, where each coin is backed by one gram of gold at launch.

The inherent slowness of the Blockchain is a problem to find the right gap between speed without compromising security, decentralization, or consensus. For example, Bitcoin has embraced the notion of being Digital Gold before they release their lightning network after the implementation of Segregated Witness. But there is a similar matter, how is the Blockchain going to scale at such a level? How can we reach Visa’s 1,700 transaction per second average and implement that in Bitcoin without compromising? Ethereum’s proposal on scaling to Ethereum 2.0 is due to sharding, which may greatly boost the speed of the chain. However, we at the Lineage Foundation have found that on-chain scaling is much needed, and thus we have come up with a solution that allows decentralization, speed, and prevents the manipulation of third parties on aspects of the ecosystem.
